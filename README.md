# TO-DO-list-app ðŸ“‘
to do list app is one of my projects which i created 
out of ideas. ðŸ¤“

### How to use 
- type a task in the input section  
- click the submit button 
- after the task is done you can now click on the task : a line runs through it 
indicating it is done 
- you can clear the whole list by clicking the CLEAR button in the top right part of the container 

### what i learnt during this project 
in this case it is actually what i learnt before making the project which were 

- creating element in javascript
```
document.createElement("ul")
document.createElement("li")
```

- creating textnode 
this is just like writing a string but this type of string is appendable to an element 
`document.createTextNode(''damax')`

- appending child 
this is just like creating a paragraph tag under a div tag eg 
```
<div>
<p> </p>
</div>
```
but using javascript 
```
document.createElement("div").appendChild(document.createElement("p"))

```
### Biggest challenge 
None
